It has enough room to hold my essentials, including a hydration bladder, snacks, and extra layers. The padded back panel and shoulder straps make it comfortable to carry, even on longer hikes. The only downside is that it lacks a dedicated rain cover, so I had to purchase one separately for added protection.\n\nFAQ\n\n71) What is the recommended load capacity for the TrailLite Daypack?\n   The TrailLite Daypack is designed to comfortably carry up to 25 lbs (11 kg) of gear, making it ideal for day hikes and short trips.\n\n72) Does the TrailLite Daypack have a specific compartment for a hydration bladder?\n   Yes, the TrailLite Daypack has a dedicated hydration sleeve inside the main compartment, along with a tube exit port for convenient access to your hydration system."
