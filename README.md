**End-to-End AI App Development: Prompt Engineering to LLMOps**

## Introduction

Prompt engineering and LLMOps are pivotal in maximizing the capabilities of Language Models (LLMs) for specific business needs. This code base is from the End-to-End AI App Development: Prompt Engineering to LLMOps Microsoft Ignite session. We'll walk you through the entire processâ€”from prototyping and experimenting to evaluating and deploying your AI-powered apps. Learn how to streamline your AI workflows and harness the full potential of Generative AI.

### Prerequisites
